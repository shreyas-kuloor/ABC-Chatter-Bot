# ABC Chatter Bot

## Description
A Discord bot built in Rust for personal use. Mainly meant for me to learn some Rust and play around with some of the capabilities of AI models. Currently a WIP.

## Features
* Chat with the bot via ChatGPT
* Generate AI art and images via Stable Diffusion
* Generate speech from text using AI speech software ElevenLabs
* Randomly reacts to messages sent in text channels with the server's custom emotes (using ChatGPT).

## TODO
* Separate system prompt for emote selector for more accurate emote selection.
* Add README section for system dependencies and environment variables.
* Look into using some sort of AI for image emotion detection to make random emoji reactions more accurate.
